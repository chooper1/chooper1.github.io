  abstract={While reasoning models have shown promising accuracy benefits through long chain-of-thought decoding, they exhibit substantial overhead at inference time due to the need to generate thousands of tokens. While sparse attention methods can help reduce the KV cache pressure induced by this long autoregressive reasoning, these methods can introduce errors which disrupt the reasoning process. In this work, we introduce Multipole Attention, which accelerates autoregressive reasoning by only computing exact attention for the most important tokens while maintaining approximate representations for the remaining tokens, achieving up to 4.5x attention speedup for long context reasoning.}

  abstract={Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document processing and coding. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction. Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work, we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved latency relative to ARMs.}

  abstract={In this work, we aim to accelerate long context length applications where much of the input context in the prompt is fixed across different user inputs. Our approach preprocesses the fixed context KV cache ahead of inference time by applying K-means clustering to group the keys based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value. At inference time, we first compare the query with the key centroids to identify important KV cache entries, and then only compute exact attention using only the important keys, thereby achieving 8X reduction in KV budget and >4x speedups with minimal accuracy loss.}

We then design a KV cache quantization strategy which retains accuracy with aggressive (~5x) compression by incorporating several novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization. Our method achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization and gets up to ~1.7x speedups.}

Building on this observation, we design a quantization strategy which aggressively reduces the memory requirements (at the expense of a small amount of additional computation). We achieve accurate low-precision (3-bit) quantization by incorporating (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization and (ii) dense-and-sparse decomposition, which together allow our method to retain close to the baseline accuracy while achieving 2.3x speedup.}
